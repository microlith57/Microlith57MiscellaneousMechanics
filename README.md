# microlith57's miscellaneous mechanics

a helper for celeste.
currently contains some public stuff:

- a controller to freeze `Scene.TimeActive`, for stunning shenanigans
- a controller to make it so you always pick up the "correct" holdable if you are in range of several (i.e. the one closest to your hand position; configurable)
- a light source that changes colour like rainbow spinners
- a trigger that makes holdables (and optionally the player) float, like it's a liquid

and also some nonpublic stuff.

this is released under the MIT license, with the informal proviso that i would prefer if you ask me before using or copying code from the unreleased entities, or discussing them publicly without spoiler tags.
