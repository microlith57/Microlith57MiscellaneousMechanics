- temple large fall anim?
- break down 'condemned' barriers

- gravity crystals for more complex gameplay; also there's spinners now
- maybe they change colour based on grav mode?

- elevator (w/ dialogue?) up to:

### test chambers

- introduce more types of recorder (with more labelled computer boxes)
  - 2 at once
  - looping
  - fast forward
  - reverse
  - pauseable
  - droste effect??? (how?)

### heist (climax)

- big complicated single-room puzzle
- lasers etc; mission impossible style breakin into vault
